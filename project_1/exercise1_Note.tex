\section*{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $k$ errors means $k$ differences (substitutions or indels)
	\item semi global alignment with dynamic programming same as Smith-Waterman algorithm with the difference that the initial gap costs for one of the sequence are not equal to zero and computing the minimum instead of maximum
	\item possible values for scoring:
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item [-] match =0
	\item [-] mismatch = 1
	\item [-] initial and internal gap cost =1
\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
	For the calculation of the number of errors it is easier if substitutions and indels have the same value (1). In the original example for semi global alignment the internal gap costs amount to 2, but I think one can change it and still semi global.
